# Results

This directory contains all outputs generated by the analysis scripts. It is organized into two subdirectories:

- **`csv/`** -- Statistical results (22 CSV files). See [`csv/README.md`](csv/README.md) for file-by-file descriptions.
- **`figures/`** -- Generated figures (35 PNG files). See [`figures/README.md`](figures/README.md) for file-by-file descriptions with manuscript cross-references.

All files in this directory are generated deterministically from the source data in `data/` using the scripts in `scripts/`. Running `scripts/run_all.py` regenerates everything.
