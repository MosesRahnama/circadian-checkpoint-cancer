## Main Text Figures

| File | Manuscript Figure | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `multicancer_circadian_cv_forest.png` | Fig 1 | Forest plot of Spearman correlations between circadian CV and PD-L1 across six TCGA cohorts. All six effects are negative and FDR-significant. |
| `multicancer_correlation_heatmap.png` | Fig 2 | Heatmap of Spearman correlations for key gene pairs across all six cohorts. Shows the divergent clock-gene pattern (BMAL1 positive, PER1 negative with PD-L1). |
| `survival_boundary_failure.png` | Fig 3 | Kaplan-Meier survival curves for Active Masking vs Decoherence across six cohorts. SKCM is FDR-significant; LUAD is nominal; others non-significant. |
| `tumor_normal_circadian_cv_paired.png` | Fig 4 | Paired tumor vs matched normal circadian CV in five cancer types. Tumors show lower CV in 4/5 types ("locked, not broken"). |
| `tumor_normal_circadian_cv_summary.png` | Fig 5 | Cohort-level summary of tumor-minus-normal circadian CV shifts. |
| `immune_subtype_prevalence_stacked.png` | Fig 6 | Stacked bar chart of AM/DC/Mixed subtype composition across six cohorts. |
| `immune_subtype_circadian_cv.png` | Fig 7 | Box/violin plots of circadian CV by boundary-failure subtype. AM consistently lower than DC in all six cohorts. |
| `immune_subtype_boundary_scatter.png` | Fig 8 | Scatter plot of checkpoint-clock boundary space colored by subtype classification. |
| `survival_test_qvalue_summary.png` | Fig 9 | Bar chart of -log10(q) for all 12 pre-specified survival tests. |
| `robustness_primary_hr_forest.png` | Fig 10 | Hazard-ratio forest plot for 8 primary robustness Cox models. |
| `rmst_am_vs_dc.png` | Fig 11 | RMST difference (AM minus DC, in months) at four time horizons with bootstrap 95% CIs. |
| `stage_circadian_cv_boxplot.png` | Fig 12 | Circadian CV by pathologic tumor stage across six cohorts. |
| `immune_residualization_scatter.png` | Fig 13 | Circadian CV vs PD-L1 after OLS immune-fraction residualization in four cohorts. |
| `purity_stratified_correlations.png` | Fig 14 | CV-PD-L1 correlations within tumor purity tertiles (low/mid/high). |
| `external_validation_geo.png` | Fig 15 | GSE91061 external validation: CV vs PD-L1, response by subtype, CV by RECIST category. |
| `thorsson_benchmarking.png` | Fig 16 | Thorsson immune subtype benchmarking: AM/DC vs C1-C6 distribution, within-subtype correlations, delta R-squared, and CCD replication. |

## Supplementary Figures

| File | Supp Figure | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `hypothesis1_TCGA_SKCM.png` | S1 | Discovery cohort detail for melanoma (SKCM): scatter plots, distributions, multi-panel. |
| `hypothesis1_TCGA_LUAD.png` | S2 | Discovery cohort detail for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). |
| `survival_circadian_quartile.png` | S3 | CV quartile survival analysis (Q1 vs Q4). All six cohorts non-significant (null result, reported for transparency). |
| `threshold_sensitivity_sweep.png` | S4 | AM/DC classification threshold sensitivity: log-rank p-values from 25th to 75th percentile. SKCM significant at 9/11 thresholds. |
| `convergent_validity_ncv.png` | S5 | Scatter plots of within-sample CV vs nCV-weighted score across six cohorts (rho = 0.30-0.60). |
